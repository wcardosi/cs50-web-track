# cs50-web-track

# Movie database. Javascript, jQuery, API, AJAX.

Last project of the course.

Surprised of the lack of discussion/feedback on previous projects. I wanted to be informed on how to code it "cleaner" or using less code. My projects worked, but I want to know possible ways on how to improve them.

This project. I would have liked more advanced CSS implemented. I will modify it later.
After I add the movies to My Watchlist, I noticed that they are not all the same height. I will learn how to correct that.
